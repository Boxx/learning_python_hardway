# Exercises 22 and 23
For exercise 22, the author suggests taking a **week** to create flashcards
and memorize the fundamental features of the Python language. I'm doing this self
study on a bit of an accelerated track and instead will take the time to write about
the topics covered so far in the preceding 21 exercises.

Finally, the author suggests studying open sourced code on public websites such as
GitHub or sourceforge (lel) and document the functionality of one of the Python
files I find.

## Language notes from preceding exercises
`print` outputs a string to stdout, Python utilizes standard conventions for
formatting symbols such as `%s` for strings, `%d` for numerics, and `%r` for a catchall

`#` or "octothorpe" is the character to indicate comments to the Python compiler and
may be used on the same line as code e.g.

```python
var = "Hello" # a comment
```

Python includes all standard mathematical operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `%`, and `/`,
additionally it includes all standard comparison operators e.g. `>`, `<`, `>=`, etc

Variables in python are declared by indicating the name followed by the assignment
operator `=` and the value being assigned. Naming conventions are snake case

Concatenation in Python is performed by using the `+` operator

When using string formatting, we pass the values to be interpolated by affixing the `%` operator
to our formatting statement followed by a list of values e.g. `% (var1, var2)`

Boolean literals are `True` and `False`

The `,` operator is used for unpacking tuples (I think)

You can print multiple lines by using trip quotes: `'''` or `"""` 

Taking command line input uses `raw_input(prompt)` and the returned value is the input

Importing modules in Python involves the `from` keyword to define the module namespace
followed by the `import` keyword and the module being imported

```python
from sys import argv
```

Getting cli arguments for scripts looks like this:

```python
from sys import argv
arg0, arg1, arg2 = argv
```

`open(path, opts)` opens a new file handler (or is it a descriptor?)
`fh.read()` will read all of a file's contents
`fh.readline()` will read one line of a file from the current position
`fh.truncate()` will nuke a file's contents
`fh.write(contents)` will write contents to a file
`fh.close()` will close an open file handler
`len` is a length function used for all kinds of things probably (only have seen strings and byte lengths right now)

Function declaration in python looks like this:

```python
def my_func(*args):
    print "Make sure there are four spaces!"
    return True

```

## Exercise 23

In this exercise I'm going to be writing a bit about an open source project on GitHub: pyhn. This is a cli application
designed to provide a terminal gui for browsing hackernews posts that is compatible with screen and tmux.

My goal for this exercise is to take notes on language features that I have not learned about yet and increase literacy.

#### Python Notes
Top of file licensing
Before class declarations there is an import section and configuration/global setting based on Python version

Looks like hash/dict definition is done using the `{` operator. There is no closing curly brace.

The first class declared is `HNException(Exception)`, it seems inheritance is defined by placing the parent class
within `()`
What does the keyword `pass` do? Looking it up...
In this use case, `pass` is used to work around Python's 'block' requirements for `class` declarations. The
`HNException` class provides no class or method bodies, therefore `pass` allows the developer to offer
a generic custom exception that behaves exactly like its parent.

Classes with no inheritance chain are declared like:
```python
class MyClass:
    """
    Class documentation
    """

    class_attribute = "Don't forget about indentation"

    def class_behavior(*args):
        """
        Function documentation
        """
```

Basic exception handling:
```python
try:
    """
    Do something that might throw an exception
    """
    file.write(contents) # Just a guess here from other langs
except Exception: # Should probably be whatever Python's IOException is
    raise MyException(message)
```

Class instances seem to be constructed by simply passing parameters into the classname `o = MyClass(param)`

A method is called and the second parameter is a "named" hash, what does this mean? `bs.find('span', attrs={'class': 'rank'})`
After looking it up it seems that all Python method arguments get stored in a dictionary...going to write a bit of weird pseudocode here

```python
def my_func(param1, param2):
    return param1 + param2

add = my_func(1, 2)
add1 = my_func(param1=1, param2=2)

# The params dictionary looks like this I think
params = {
    'param1': 1
    'param2': 2
```

This allows you to call functions by supplying params in their 'correct' order OR naming them directly when calling

Slicing lists in python looks like this: `list[0:5]`
This also works on strings and tuples
SO tells me that this passes a `slice` object to `__getitem__` or other equivalent methods

Casting to ints: `int(string)`

String splitting: `my_string.split(delimiter)` must return some list or dict datatype

Regex stuff: `regex_object = regex.compile(my_regex)`
`result = regex_object.search(string)`
`capture_groups = result.group()`

"This instance" is `self`

Looping:
```python
for index in range(1, len(list)):
    print i
```

Creating an empty list: `my_list = []`
Appending to a list: `my_list += 1337`

#### Code analysis

`hnapi.py` declares four new datatypes for use in this program: `HNException`, `HackerNewsAPI`, `HackerNewsStory`, and `HackerNewsUser`

`HNException` is an exception to be thrown when there are HN server issues or there were errors returned when attempting
to access the HN API.

`HackerNewsAPI` wraps all HN API functions in methods and uses a HTTP library called `BeautifulSoup` to perform the HTTP requests. It also
includes 'common' functions needed by the core behaviors that parse particular pieces of the server responses. "Story" and "User" methods
return single instances or collections of the `HackerNewsStory` and `HackerNewsUser` datatypes.

`HackerNewsStory` and `HackerNewsUser` are object representations of the HN DSL
