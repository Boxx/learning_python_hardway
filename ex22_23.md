# Exercises 22 and 23
For exercise 22, the author suggests taking a **week** to create flashcards
and memorize the fundamental features of the Python language. I'm doing this self
study on a bit of an accelerated track and instead will take the time to write about
the topics covered so far in the preceding 21 exercises.

Finally, the author suggests studying open sourced code on public websites such as
GitHub or sourceforge (lel) and document the functionality of one of the Python
files I find.

## Language notes from preceding exercises
1. `print` outputs a string to stdout, Python utilizes standard conventions for
formatting symbols such as `%s` for strings, `%d` for numerics, and `%r` for a catchall

2. `#` or "octothorpe" is the character to indicate comments to the Python compiler and
may be used on the same line as code e.g.

```python
var = "Hello" # a comment
```

3. Python includes all standard mathematical operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `%`, and `/`,
additionally it includes all standard comparison operators e.g. `>`, `<`, `>=`, etc

4. Variables in python are declared by indicating the name followed by the assignment
operator `=` and the value being assigned. Naming conventions are snake case

5. Concatenation in Python is performed by using the `+` operator

6. When using string formatting, we pass the values to be interpolated by affixing the `%` operator
to our formatting statement followed by a list of values e.g. `% (var1, var2)`

7. Boolean literals are `True` and `False`

8. The `,` operator is used for unpacking tuples (I think)

9. You can print multiple lines by using trip quotes: `'''` or `"""` 

10. Taking command line input uses `raw_input(prompt)` and the returned value is the input

11. Importing modules in Python involves the `from` keyword to define the module namespace
followed by the `import` keyword and the module being imported

```python
from sys import argv
```

12. Getting cli arguments for scripts looks like this:

```python
from sys import argv
arg0, arg1, arg2 = argv
```

13. `open(path, opts)` opens a new file handler (or is it a descriptor?)
14. `fh.read()` will read all of a file's contents
15. `fh.readline()` will read one line of a file from the current position
15. `fh.truncate()` will nuke a file's contents
16. `fh.write(contents)` will write contents to a file
17. `fh.close()` will close an open file handler
18. `len` is a length function used for all kinds of things probably (only have seen strings and byte lengths right now)
19. Function declaration in python looks like this:

```python
def my_func(*args):
    print "Make sure there are four spaces!"
    return True

```
